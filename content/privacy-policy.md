#### Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect information about your use of our website. Google Analytics 
                        collects information such as how often users visit the site, what pages they visit when they do
                        so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our website. We use the information we get
                        from Google Analytics to improve our website and the user experience. Google Analytics collects
                        only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, rather than your name or
                        other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of
                        Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google Analytics plants a permanent
                        cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website.
                        This cookie cannot be used by anyone other than Google. Googleâ€™s ability to use and share
                        information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our website is restricted by the
                        Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>

#### Data Retention and Security

We retain the information we collect for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which
                        it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law. We take reasonable
                        measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to
                    use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.
